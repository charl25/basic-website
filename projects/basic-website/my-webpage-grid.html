                        <p>St George's Cathedral is the oldest Cathedral in southern Africa and is the Mother Church of the diocese.
                            The gothic church is a classic cruciform building, with a courtyard garden which includes a Labyrinth.
                            The administrative offices of the Cathedral are housed in cloisters facing the courtyard.</p>
                        <p>The original St George's Church had been built in the style of St Pancras Church in London, featuring six stone pillars whose places are marked today by oak trees on the Cathedral steps.
                            It opened at Christmas 1834, and was made a cathedral in 1847 in anticipation of the arrival of the first Anglican Bishop in Africa, Robert Gray.
                            However, he didn't like it. Both Bishop Gray and his successor William West Jones wished for a grander cathedral, but neither lived to see it built.
                            The current building was designed by the famous architect Herbert Baker.</p>
                        <p>The foundation stone was laid in 1901 by the future King George V and can be seen from the bottom of the Avenue leading into the Company's Garden.
                            Construction did not begin until 1906, however, starting at the eastern end, and the completion of the north transept in 1936 finally brought Herbert Baker's design to life.
                            In 1963 the Lady Chapel and south aisle were completed, and in 1978 the Bell Tower and the Link were built.
                            The Cathedral remains a work-in-progress, however, as there was intended to be a Chapter House attached to the end of the Link.</p>

                        <p>The oldest colonial building in South Africa, the Castle of Good Hope, is a pentagonal fortress built by Dutch colonialists in the 17th century.
                            The well-known landmark is central to the history of Cape Town, having served as the seat of government and military operations for two centuries.
                            A tour of the Castle’s two museums and expansive grounds offer fascinating insight into Cape Town’s military and cultural past.</p>
                            <p>The Castle Military Museum houses an impressive array of military artifacts and exhibits from the 17th to the 19th centuries.
                                Other attractions include the Dolphin Pool, bakery, officers’ living quarters, and the Donker Gat (Dark Hole), where prisoners awaiting trial were held.
                                The De Goewerneur Restaurant serves delicious Malay, Dutch and French cuisine on-site.</p>
                             <p>If you visit, you can also catch the changing of the guard at noon and the Key Ceremony (replicating the ceremonial unlocking of the Castle) at 10am and noon every weekday.</p>

                        <p>District Six was established in 1867, one of six districts in Cape Town.
                            The area, on the outskirts of the inner city was vibrant, colourful and crowded.
                            District Six was a vibrant centre with close links to the city and the port.
                            By the beginning of the 20th century, however, the process of removals and marginalisation had begun.
                            People of all colours – residents, immigrants, artisans and merchants – owned and rented houses.
                            They lived in harmony and were close to their places of work, school, worship and entertainment.              
                            In 1901 all the black people were forced to move out, and as the decades passed by it became a predominantly coloured community.</p> 
                        <p>The District Six Museum in the old Methodist Mission Church recalls the life of this once-vibrant, racially mixed suburb and its destruction under apartheid.
                            This museum in Cape Town seeks to reconnect with the spirit of the community and provide a different interpretation of the past.
                            There are many places in Cape Town where you can capture the spirit of a bygone era, but the District Six Museum is where you will find the heart and soul of a broken community.</p>
